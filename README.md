## Description

This is an iOS app that displays videos from YouTubeâ€™s API given a search query and streams audio in the deviceâ€™s background, allowing users to preserve battery while listening! Ultimately, it fuses YouTubeâ€™s vast library with Spotifyâ€™s ease-of-use.

## "Why?" (Motivation/Goal)

One day, I was on a walk and wanted to listen to a Nintendo song that wasn't available on Spotify. The only way to listen to it was via YouTube, but this required keeping the YouTube app open while listening, which caused significant battery drainage and overheating on my device. To solve this problem, I decided to build my own app. I designed the app to fetch audio streams from YouTube, allowing users to listen in the background while minimizing battery usage. I incorporated features to pre-fetch and cache audio streams to make playback more efficient and less taxing on the device's battery.
